# Windows on the Lg V50

## Dual Boot

  First, restore the boot copy you made before and boot android.

  Then install [uefi installer](https://github.com/edk2-porting/edk2-msm/actions/runs/4165267962) in Magisk as a module (It has to be decompressed once, otherwise it will give an error).

## Note

  Sometimes Android won't boot, don't worry, just go back to your previous backup of boot_a and boot_b with Qfil and reinstall the uefi installer.
